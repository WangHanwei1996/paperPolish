| Original Text | Revised Text | Reason for Modification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Considering a buldge | Consider a bulge | Corrected the spelling error "buldge" to "bulge". |
| with constant depth ,which fluctuates | with a constant depth, subject to fluctuations | Improved the readability by rephrasing the sentence. The pronoun 'which' is replaced with 'subject to' for better clarity. |
| as the buldge collapses | as the bulge collapses | Corrected the spelling error "buldge" to "bulge". |
| under the action of gravity. | under the force of gravity. | "Action" is a broad term. For better clarity and precision, "force" is used, which is more commonly associated with gravity in scientific literature. |
| With the usual lubrication assumption that the height of the drop is small compared with its lateral extent | Applying the conventional lubrication assumption, which suggests that the height of the drop is negligible in comparison to its lateral extent | For better readability and to make the sentence more concise, rephrased the sentence using more suitable vocabulary. "Applying" and "suggests" provide better connotations in this context. "Negligible" is more precise and academically used than "small". |
| and for two-dimensional axisymmetric, irrotational, incompressible, viscous flow with velocity (u, w),pressure p ,density rho,and fluid density 洧랥洧노 | and considering a two-dimensional, axisymmetric, irrotational, incompressible, and viscous flow with velocity parameters (u, w), pressure p, density rho, and fluid tension 洧랥洧노 | Improved readability by rephrasing and punctuating properly. "Considering" is used to introduce the flow characteristics in a more academic tone. Added the word 'parameters' to specify (u, w) better. Corrected "fluid density" to "fluid tension" because 洧랥洧노 typically refers to fluid or surface tension. |
| the governing equations of the whole process are : | the governing equations for this entire process are: | Rephrased the sentence for better readability and removed the unnecessary space before the colon. |

| Original Text | Revised Text | Reason for Modification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Numerical simulation results from bulge collapse show that there is quite difference | Numerical simulation outcomes from the bulge collapse indicate a significant difference | "Outcomes" sounds more academic than "results". "Indicate a significant difference" is clearer and more formal than "show that there is quite difference". |
| between before and after the bulge height at the axisymmetric axis is equal to the stationary film depth. | in the bulge height at the axisymmetric axis, before and after it equals the stationary film depth. | Restructured the sentence for better readability and clarity. The revised structure improves the flow and clarity of the sentence by clarifying the point of comparison (before and after the bulge height equals the stationary film depth). |
| Hence we divide the whole process into the two stages, diffusion and propagation processes: | Consequently, we partition the entire process into two distinct stages: the diffusion process and the propagation process. | "Consequently" is more formal than "Hence". The verb "partition" is more specific than "divide", and "distinct stages" provides a clearer understanding than "the two stages". The revised sentence has better flow and readability. |
